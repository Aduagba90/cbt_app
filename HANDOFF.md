## Context for a new chat

> I have a Flask/SQLite CBT exam-practice app called **PrepNova CBT** for Nigerian students
> (JAMB, WAEC, Post-UTME; Paystack subscriptions). Repo: https://github.com/Aduagba90/cbt_app
> (branch `main`). It was recently rebuilt: JAMB-style exam engine (`exam_engine.py`),
> security hardening (`security.py`), new design system (`static/css/prepnova.css`),
> admin blueprint (`admin_routes.py`), Admin → Subscriptions page with manual activation,
> zero-config local run (`python app.py` = development mode, admin `admin@gmail.com` / `admin123`).
> Production needs `.env` with `SECRET_KEY`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, Paystack keys.
> Read `README.md`, `HANDOFF.md` and `docs/QUESTION_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` in the repo first. Known open items: 239 English
> explanations are boilerplate; Post-UTME has 0 questions; rotate Paystack keys/admin
> password that exist in old git history. Today's task: <describe it>.

## Question content batches (Sept 2026)
New applied-style questions live in `content/batch_*.json` and are written by `scripts/build_content_batch*.py`
(numerical answers are re-computed in Python before the file is written). `content_loader.apply_pending()` runs
inside `init_db()`, so every database — developer, preview, and the live PythonAnywhere copy with student data —
receives each batch exactly once (tracked in `app_settings` as `content_batch_<id>`). Nothing is deleted: retired
recall questions are set to `status='Inactive'`. Comprehension passages go in the `passages` table and are linked via
`questions_v2.passage_id`; the exam engine shows a passage's questions together (max 2 passages per subject per mock).
Batches 001-009 (Sept 2026) cover all 11 JAMB subjects, two rounds each: ~1,230 curated exam-standard questions,
15 passages (comprehension, two cloze passages with numbered gaps, unseen poems/prose/drama, an Economics
demand-supply schedule, a Mathematics frequency table). Roughly 1,090 weak recall items retired (Inactive).
`questions_v2.tier` = 1 for curated batch items (`_retag` marks them by text on every start), 0 for the old bank.
`exam_engine._arrange()` builds each subject block as: up to 2 passages first (different kinds preferred), then at
least half of the questions from tier 1, the rest from the general bank, shuffled. Deactivation rules in a batch's
`deactivate` list are generic (`subject`, `topic`, `only_without_passage`, `max_length`, `no_digit`, `starts_with`,
`like`, `telegraphic`, `keep_at_least` floor) and only ever touch tier-0 Active rows. Passages whose text contains
runs of spaces render as monospace tables (`passage_class` filter / `.pn-table`). Quality gates used by the build
scripts: numeric answers verified, no duplicate options, explanation ≥ 25 chars, no "option X" in explanations,
answer letters balanced A–D, correct option never > 1.5× the longest distractor (`scripts/distractor_fixes.py`).

Round 3 (batches 010–011, Sept 2026) added 383 Use of English questions written to the JAMB syllabus (12 comprehension
+ 10 cloze passages, sentence interpretation, synonyms, antonyms, grammar/sentence completion, oral English), taking
English to 552 curated questions and 30 passages. Two engine rules were added at the same time:

* **Auto-retire at 500** (`content_loader._auto_retire`, `AUTO_RETIRE_AT`): once a subject has ≥ 500 Active tier-1
  questions, every remaining tier-0 (old bank) question of that subject is set Inactive. It runs after each
  `apply_pending()`, so each subject switches over automatically as its curated bank grows. English switched over
  in this round (97 old items retired; the setting `content_auto_retire_<subject_id>` records it).
* **No repeats** (`exam_engine._seen_questions` / `_arrange(seen=)`): questions and passages a student met in earlier
  (submitted/expired/abandoned) attempts are used only when the unseen ones run out. Index
  `idx_attempts_user_status` supports the lookup. With 552 English items a student sees no repeated English question
  for the first 9 mocks; other subjects still repeat because their banks are smaller.

**Reading text (recommended novel).** Batch 012 adds 115 questions on *The Lekki Headmaster* (Kabir Alabi Garba),
the UTME Use of English novel since 2025, under the topic `Reading Text: The Lekki Headmaster`. `exam_engine._arrange`
places exactly `READING_TEXT_QUESTIONS` (10) of them straight after the passages in every full English paper, as JAMB
does; unseen ones first. When JAMB announces a new novel: write `scripts/build_content_batch<N>.py` with topic
`Reading Text: <new title>` and put the old topic name in that batch's `"retire_topics"` list — the loader switches
the old novel off on the next start. Novel-question sources: chapter summaries only (no copyrighted text is quoted).

**Fixed English sections.** `exam_engine.SECTION_QUOTAS` fixes the rest of the English paper after the passages and
the novel: sentence interpretation (topic `Lexis and Structure`) 5, `Antonyms` 5, `Synonyms` 5, `Sentence Completion`
10, `Oral English` 10 — so every mock is 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 10 + 10 = 60, like the UTME. The quotas apply only
when all five topics exist in a subject's curated pool (i.e. English); other subjects keep the mixed draw.

Questions added through Admin → Add question / Import v2 are inserted as tier 1 (they count towards the 500).
Cross-batch duplicate stems are silently skipped by the loader (dedupe on subject + text + passage), so check for
duplicates before writing a batch (see the ad-hoc check in the round-3 build session: same stem in an earlier batch).
**Sciences round 3 (batches 013–015, Sept 2026).** Biology +196 (four data passages: quadrat counts, food tests,
germination, potometer), Chemistry +235 (Na₂CO₃ titration table, Mg/HCl rate data, standard electrode potentials,
KNO₃ solubility table; every one of the 15 topics covered, including separation techniques and radioactivity that
had no curated items) and Physics +260 (velocity–time table, cell terminal-p.d. readings, heating curve, simple
pendulum data). Curated totals are now Biology 264, Chemistry 324, Physics 343 (of 500 for auto-retire). Batches
014+ use the shared builder `scripts/batch_common.py::build_batch()` — same gates as before plus a near-duplicate
scan (exact stem or Jaccard ≥ 0.6 on 4-letter words) against every other batch file and the Active rows of
`database.db`; warnings are printed, not fatal, so read them and reword the stems. Table passages (any line with a
run of ≥ 3 spaces) are rendered by the `passage_html` filter / `renderPassage()` in `exam_room.html`: the prose
before and after the table is re-flowed into normal wrapping paragraphs and only the table block itself is
monospace (`<pre class="pn-tbl">`, smaller font under 420 px). Table rows must therefore be ≤ 42 characters so they
fit a 360 px phone without sideways scrolling; prose length no longer matters (the builder still wraps it).
Teacher review sheets for the three sciences are in `docs/review/`.
Next: Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Maths to 500 each, then arts; then Post-UTME bank, WAEC bank, then offline mode.

## Where things are

| Item | Location |
|---|---|
| App entry / student routes | `app.py` |
| Admin routes (blueprint) | `admin_routes.py` |
| Exam engine (attempts, timer, scoring, review) | `exam_engine.py` |
| Security (CSRF, rate limits, lockout, decorators) | `security.py` |
| Shared helpers (subscriptions, email, formatting) | `helpers.py` |
| DB connection + migrations | `db.py` |
| Design system | `static/css/prepnova.css`, `static/js/prepnova.js` |
| Templates (student = extend `base.html`; admin = legacy pages + injected `_admin_bar.html`) | `templates/` |
| Seed database (question bank) | `database.db` |
| Data-fix scripts | `scripts/` (see `scripts/README.md`) |
| Regression script (test client, ~65 checks) | `_work/regress.py` (not committed; recreate if needed) |

## Feature switches

- `WAEC_ENABLED` (env, default `0`): WAEC mocks + practice are "Coming soon" and blocked
  server-side until set to `1` after the genuine WAEC bank is uploaded.
- Post-UTME shows "Coming soon" automatically while `post_utme_questions` is empty.

## Growth features (student retention)
- **Daily Challenge** `/challenge`: 5 curated questions per day (same set per student per day, stored in `daily_challenge`), one attempt, explanations after submit, "you beat N%" shown only once ≥3 students played that day.
- **Study streak**: consecutive days with any activity (mock result, practice via `daily_usage`, or challenge) — `helpers.study_streak()`; shown on dashboard + challenge page.
- **Invite friends** `/invite`: each user gets `users.referral_code` (e.g. `AMINA-7K3Q`, created lazily). `/register?ref=CODE` stores `referred_by` + a `referrals` row. When the invited student submits their **first** mock (`exam_engine.finalize_attempt`), both get `REFERRAL_REWARD_DAYS` (3) added via `helpers.extend_subscription_days()` (extends trial/plan, or inserts a `BONUS` subscription row). Cap: 20 rewarded friends per inviter. Unknown codes are ignored silently.
- **WhatsApp share**: result slip + challenge result build a `wa.me/?text=` link (`helpers.share_text()`); scores under 50% get a neutral "invite a study partner" message instead of a score boast. Uses the public `/verify_result/<code>` link so the score is verifiable.
- **Access PINs** (admin → Access PINs, `/access_codes`): vouchers `PN-XXXX-XXXX` or a custom word, N days, max uses, optional expiry. Students redeem at Subscribe → "Have an Access PIN?" (`POST /redeem_pin`, rate-limited 8/10 min). `helpers.redeem_access_code()` → `grant_days()` (extends a paid plan; upgrades trial/bonus rows to `ACCESS_CODE`), redemptions are logged in `access_code_redemptions` (no `payments` row — that table has a FK to real plans). This is how testers get full mock access without Paystack.
- **Fix my mistakes** (`/mistakes`, `/mistakes/fix[/<subject>]`): every wrong/blank answer in a mock or practice is upserted into `mistakes` (`record_mistake`), a correct answer clears it (`clear_mistake`). Drill shows hardest (most-missed) first.
- **Target & projection**: `users.target_score` (POST `/set_target`, 100–400); `helpers.jamb_projection()` = average `jamb_score` of last 3 full JAMB mocks; shown on dashboard + result slip. **Pace meter**: `helpers.pace_info()` seconds/question vs allowed (JAMB 40 s) on the result slip.
- Landing: "Only on PrepNova" section (`#only`) advertises these; hero badges float beside the mock card on desktop and become a stacked chip row under it on phones (`.pn-float-badge` rules in prepnova.css).

## Growing the question bank

See `docs/QUESTION_BANK_GUIDE.md` (Excel template → Admin → Import; topics auto-created;
mocks and practice share one bank).

## Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py            # http://localhost:5000  (dev mode, no .env needed)
```

## Deploy

`docs/GO_LIVE.md` is the owner-facing guide. Chosen host: **PythonAnywhere free** via
`scripts/pythonanywhere_setup.py` (run in a PA Bash console; first run installs + creates the
web app through the PA API, later runs = update mode: git reset to origin/main + reload).
Settings live in `~/.prepnova.env`, data in `~/prepnova-data/database.db` (journal mode DELETE).
Owner update routine = `git push origin main` (Windows) then `python3 setup.py` (PA console).
`render.yaml` kept as an alternative.
Production: `gunicorn app:app`, `SECRET_KEY`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `DATABASE_PATH`
on a persistent disk (seeded from repo `database.db` on first boot), `APP_URL`, Paystack keys.

## Commit history of the rebuild

- `827c01a` Rebuild: JAMB-style exam engine, security hardening, new UI
- `054b982` JSON 401 for signed-out exam clients, price typography
- `a695916` Timezone-aware UTC helper
- `0d7eac2` Lift login lockout after password reset
- `c3f41b6` Fix admin corrections view, retire legacy uploader
- `10a4c3e` Zero-config local run
- `0fb7d7b` Admin subscriptions console + Paystack key checks

## Phone navigation, prices & Plans page (Sept 2026)
- **Bottom app bar on phones/tablets** (`.pn-tabbar` in `base.html`, hidden ≥992px and inside the exam room via
  `body.pn-exam-body`): Home · Mocks · Practice · Results · Subscribe. A `.pn-tabbar-space` spacer keeps the footer
  and sticky elements (`.pn-challenge-actions`) above it. The avatar dropdown lost the duplicate links and is now 8 items.
- **Prices**: Monthly ₦1,000 / Quarterly ₦2,500 / Yearly ₦8,000. `init_db()` applies this ONCE (flag
  `plans_repriced_2026_09` in the new `app_settings` key/value table) and never touches prices again.
- **Admin → Plans** (`/manage_plans`, `POST /manage_plans/<id>`): edit price (₦100–₦1,000,000), description, on/off
  (at least one plan must stay on). Audited as `save_plan`. Landing, Subscribe and Paystack all read `subscription_plans`.
- Cache-bust: css `?v=7` (base.html + _admin_bar.html).
